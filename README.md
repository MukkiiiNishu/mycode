Great! Moving to a MySQL database for storing transcripts will provide more robustness, scalability, and persistence. Let's go through the process step by step.

Step 1: Setting Up MySQL
1.1. Install MySQL:
If MySQL is not already installed, you can install it using the following command:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
Start the MySQL service:
bash
Copy code
sudo service mysql start
1.2. Secure MySQL Installation:
Run the following command to secure your MySQL installation:
bash
Copy code
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Follow the prompts to set the root password and remove insecure default settings.
1.3. Log in to MySQL:
Log in to the MySQL shell:
bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
1.4. Create a Database:
Create a new database for storing the transcripts:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE learning_assistant_db;
Switch to the newly created database:
sql
Copy code
USE learning_assistant_db;
1.5. Create a Table:
Create a table to store the transcripts. The table can store the video ID, transcript text, and any other relevant data:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE transcripts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    video_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    transcript TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Step 2: Set Up a Node.js Backend with Express
2.1. Initialize a Node.js Project:
Navigate to your project directory and initialize a Node.js project:
bash
Copy code
mkdir learning-assistant-backend
cd learning-assistant-backend
npm init -y
2.2. Install Required Packages:
Install the following packages:
bash
Copy code
npm install express mysql2 body-parser cors
Express: For creating the server.
MySQL2: For interacting with MySQL.
Body-Parser: To parse incoming request bodies.
CORS: To handle cross-origin requests.
2.3. Set Up the Express Server:
Create an index.js file for your Express server:

bash
Copy code
touch index.js
Add the following code to index.js to set up a basic server and connect to MySQL


To ensure your project runs smoothly, here are all the dependencies you need to install for both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) parts of the project.

Frontend (React) Dependencies
These dependencies are required for the frontend part of your project:

React and React DOM:

These are the core libraries for building the UI.
bash
Copy code
npm install react react-dom
Styled-Components:

This is used for styling components in a modular and reusable way.
bash
Copy code
npm install styled-components
Axios:

Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend.
bash
Copy code
npm install axios
GlobalStyles (if used):

If you’re using a global styling approach, ensure you have a GlobalStyles.js file or equivalent in your styles directory.
Backend (Node.js) Dependencies
These dependencies are required for the backend part of your project:

Express:

A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
bash
Copy code
npm install express
Cors:

Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making it possible for your frontend to communicate with your backend.
bash
Copy code
npm install cors
Multer:

A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is used for file uploads.
bash
Copy code
npm install multer
Fluent-FFmpeg:

A fluent API for working with FFmpeg, used to extract audio from video files.
bash
Copy code
npm install fluent-ffmpeg
MySQL2:

A MySQL client for Node.js with support for modern features like Promises.
bash
Copy code
npm install mysql2
Child Process (Built-in):

You don’t need to install this separately as it’s a built-in module in Node.js, used for running shell commands (e.g., calling the Python transcription script).
It’s used as:
javascript
Copy code
const { execSync } = require('child_process');
Python (for Whisper):

Make sure Python is installed on your server/system.
Install Whisper (for transcription):
bash
Copy code
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
FFmpeg:

Install FFmpeg on your server/system to handle audio extraction from video files.
Installation varies by platform, but here’s how you can install it on Ubuntu:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
Final Notes
Backend Startup:

Ensure your MySQL server is running and the necessary tables are created before starting the backend.
Start the backend using:
bash
Copy code
node index.js
Frontend Startup:

Run the React development server using:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Summary
With these dependencies installed, your project should be fully operational. The frontend handles video uploads and interacts with the backend, while the backend processes the video, performs transcription, and stores the transcript in MySQL.


The "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'" error usually occurs because MySQL's root user is configured to authenticate using the auth_socket plugin, which only allows connections via the local Unix socket and not using a password. This is common on newer installations of MySQL on Ubuntu.

Step 1: Log in to MySQL as Root User Using sudo
Since the root user might be configured to authenticate via the auth_socket plugin, you'll need to log in using sudo:

bash
Copy code
sudo mysql -u root
Step 2: Change the Authentication Method for the Root User
Once you're logged in, you can change the authentication method to mysql_native_password, which allows you to use a password for the root user.

Switch to MySQL Database:

sql
Copy code
USE mysql;
Update the Authentication Method:

Run the following command to set the root user to authenticate with a password:

sql
Copy code
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_new_password';
Replace 'your_new_password' with a strong password of your choice.

Flush Privileges:

Apply the changes by flushing the privileges:

sql
Copy code
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Exit MySQL:

sql
Copy code
EXIT;
Step 3: Log in Using the New Password
Now, you should be able to log in using the password:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
